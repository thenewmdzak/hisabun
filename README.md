FOSS Personal Accounting App that follows the Shariah
-----------------------------------------------------
Hi There My name is Mohammed Zakaria Ghojaria and I 
have recently started to learn computer programming
and computing in general and had the idea of making
an open source app that would auto-calculate certain
expenses, incomes and things such as zakat-payable 
automatically. This is going to be an ongoing project
for a very long time is my guess. As I learn more I
will work on this project. Wish me Luck !!!!!
